# Bulk Image Converter :fire:
Helper script to convert a folder's worth of images from one filetype to another, and optionally delete originals

## Use
-[Setup](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) / Activate a virtual environment in your chosen directory 
-Pip install [the pillow library](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for working with images
-Read through `convert.py` and update the global variables
-Run the script and then marvel at how much time you saved over converting all those images manually :sunglasses:
